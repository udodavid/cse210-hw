1. Meaning of Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used with different underlying forms (data types). The term polymorphism is derived from the Greek words "poly" (many) and "morph" (form), meaning "many forms."

2. Benefit of Polymorphism
One key benefit of polymorphism is its ability to simplify code and enhance reusability. By allowing objects to be processed based on their superclass type, polymorphism promotes flexibility in code design. It reduces the complexity of handling different object types, enabling developers to write more generic and maintainable code. This is particularly useful when implementing interfaces or abstract classes, as it ensures that new object types can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

3. Application of Polymorphism
Polymorphism is widely used in scenarios where different classes are required to perform similar operations but with different implementations. For instance, in a graphic drawing application, different shapes (like circles, squares, and triangles) can be drawn using a common interface or abstract class for shapes. Each shape class would implement the drawing method in its unique way, yet they can all be managed through a single interface.

4. Code Example of Polymorphism from the Program I wrote
In the Develop05 program, polymorphism is implemented through an abstract base class Goal and its derived classes SimpleGoal, EternalGoal, and ChecklistGoal. Here's a detailed explanation:

Abstract Base Class (Goal):

abstract class Goal
{
    protected string _name;
    protected string _description;
    protected int _points;

    public Goal(string name, string description, int points)
    {
        _name = name;
        _description = description;
        _points = points;
    }

    public abstract void RecordEvent();
    public abstract bool IsComplete();
    public abstract string GetDetailsString();
    public abstract string GetStringRepresentation();
    public int GetPoints() => _points;
}
Derived Classes:

SimpleGoal
EternalGoal
ChecklistGoal
Each derived class overrides the abstract methods defined in Goal.

5. Explanation
In the EternalQuest program, polymorphism allows the GoalManager class to handle different types of goals (simple, eternal, and checklist) through a single interface provided by the Goal base class. The RecordEvent method in GoalManager can call the RecordEvent method on any goal, regardless of its specific type, because each goal class implements this method differently.

private void RecordEvent()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Select a goal to record an event: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < _goals.Count; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{i + 1}. {_goals[i].GetDetailsString()}");
    }
    int choice = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()) - 1;

    if (choice >= 0 && choice < _goals.Count)
    {
        _goals[choice].RecordEvent();
        _score += _goals[choice].GetPoints();
        if (_goals[choice].IsComplete() && _goals[choice] is ChecklistGoal checklistGoal)
        {
            _score += checklistGoal.GetBonus();
        }
        CheckLevelUp();
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid choice.");
    }
}
This code snippet demonstrates polymorphism as the RecordEvent method interacts with a list of Goal objects, calling the appropriate overridden RecordEvent method based on the actual type of each goal object.

In summary, polymorphism enhances code flexibility and reusability by allowing objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface, facilitating easier management and extension of codebases.
