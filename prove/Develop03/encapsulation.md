Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, usually a class. It allows us to hide the internal state of an object and only expose the necessary functionality, which helps in protecting the data from unauthorized access and modification.

Benefits of Encapsulation:
One of the key benefits of encapsulation is that it provides better control over the data by preventing unauthorized access. It also allows for easier maintenance and modification of code, as changes can be made within the class without affecting the code that uses the class.

Application of Encapsulation:
In the program we developed, encapsulation is applied in the Scripture and Word classes. The Scripture class encapsulates the scripture text and reference, and the Word class encapsulates individual words within the scripture.

Example of Encapsulation from the program I wrote:

class Scripture
{
    private string reference;
    private List<Word> words;

    public Scripture(string reference, string text)
    {
        this.reference = reference;
        words = new List<Word>();

        // Split the text into words
        string[] wordArray = text.Split(' ');

        // Add words to the list
        foreach (string word in wordArray)
        {
            words.Add(new Word(word));
        }
    }

    // Others
}

class Word
{
    public string Text { get; }
    public bool IsHidden { get; private set; }

    public Word(string text)
    {
        Text = text;
        IsHidden = false;
    }

    public void Hide()
    {
        IsHidden = true;
    }
}
In my code, the Scripture class encapsulates the scripture text and reference, and the Word class encapsulates individual words within the scripture. The data (text, reference, word) is encapsulated within their respective classes, and access to this data is controlled through methods. For example, the Hide() method in the Word class encapsulates the functionality to hide a word within the scripture.
