# Brief Definitions of the Four Principles of Programming with Classes
1. `Abstraction`
Definition: Abstraction is the principle of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. It involves creating a simplified representation of an object by including only the necessary attributes and methods, hiding the complex implementation details.
Usage in Final Project: In the YouTube Videos program, abstraction was used to represent videos and comments. The Video class encapsulates the attributes like title, author, and length, and provides methods to interact with the comments. The Comment class abstracts the commenter and the text of the comment.

2. `Encapsulation`
Definition: Encapsulation is the practice of keeping the internal state of an object hidden from the outside world and only exposing a controlled interface. This helps to protect the integrity of the object's state by preventing outside interference and misuse.
Usage in Final Project: In the Online Ordering program, encapsulation was implemented by making member variables private and providing public getters and setters. The Order, Product, Customer, and Address classes encapsulate their respective data and expose methods to interact with that data, ensuring that each class controls how its data is accessed and modified.

3. `Inheritance`
Definition: Inheritance is the principle by which a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. This allows for a hierarchical classification and promotes code reusability.
Usage in Final Project: In the Event Planning program, inheritance was used to create a base Event class and derived classes like Lecture, Reception, and OutdoorGathering. Each specific event type inherits common attributes and methods from the Event class, while adding its own specific attributes and behaviors.

4. `Polymorphism`
Definition: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even when using a unified interface. It enables a single interface to be used for a general class of actions.
Usage in Final Project: In the Exercise Tracking program, polymorphism was utilized by defining a base Activity class with virtual methods for getting distance, speed, and pace. The derived classes Running, Cycling, and Swimming override these methods to provide specific implementations. This allows different activity objects to be treated uniformly while exhibiting different behaviors.

# How Using These Principles Helped the Final Project Become More Flexible for Future Changes
Using these principles made the final project more flexible and easier to maintain in several ways:

* `Abstraction:`
Example: By abstracting the Video and Comment classes in the YouTube Videos program, it becomes easy to extend functionality, such as adding new attributes (like video category or comment timestamp) without affecting existing code that interacts with videos and comments. This helps in focusing on high-level design rather than implementation details.

* `Encapsulation:`
Example: Encapsulation in the Online Ordering program ensures that changes to the internal representation of data (like changing how an address is formatted or stored) do not affect other parts of the program. For instance, if the Address class implementation changes, only the Address class needs to be updated, and the rest of the code remains unaffected due to the controlled interface.

* `Inheritance:`
Example: Inheritance in the Event Planning program allows for easy addition of new event types. For instance, if a new event type such as Webinar needs to be added, it can simply inherit from the Event class and add its specific attributes and methods. This promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy, as common event-related code resides in the Event base class.

* `Polymorphism:`
Example: Polymorphism in the Exercise Tracking program provides flexibility in handling different types of activities through a common interface. Adding a new activity type (like Hiking) would involve creating a new derived class and overriding the necessary methods. The existing code that processes a list of activities remains unchanged, thus making the system extensible and scalable.

Overall, these principles together promote a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase. They help in isolating changes, enhancing code readability, and facilitating easier debugging and testing. By adhering to these principles, the final project becomes robust and adaptable to future requirements and changes.
